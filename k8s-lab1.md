## Kubernetes Architecture Lab

### Objective
Test your knowledge of Kubernetes architecture through a series of multiple-choice questions.

### Questions

1. **What is the primary role of the Kubernetes API Server (`kube-apiserver`)?**
   - A. Stores cluster configuration data
   - B. Schedules pods to nodes
   - C. Exposes the Kubernetes API and handles requests
   - D. Manages network rules on nodes

2. **Which component of Kubernetes is responsible for storing the clusterâ€™s configuration data?**
   - A. API Server
   - B. Etcd
   - C. Controller Manager
   - D. Scheduler

3. **What does the Kubernetes Scheduler (`kube-scheduler`) do?**
   - A. Monitors the health of containers
   - B. Decides which pods run on which nodes
   - C. Manages network communication between pods
   - D. Ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running

4. **Which Kubernetes component ensures that the desired state of the cluster matches the current state?**
   - A. API Server
   - B. Etcd
   - C. Controller Manager
   - D. Kubelet

5. **What is a Pod in Kubernetes?**
   - A. A set of nodes that manage containers
   - B. A single container instance
   - C. The smallest deployable unit consisting of one or more containers
   - D. A network policy for containers

6. **Which component is responsible for maintaining network rules on nodes to enable communication between pods?**
   - A. Kubelet
   - B. API Server
   - C. Kube-Proxy
   - D. Controller Manager

7. **In Kubernetes, what is the role of the Container Runtime?**
   - A. Manages network traffic within the cluster
   - B. Runs containers and manages their execution
   - C. Exposes the Kubernetes API
   - D. Stores the cluster's configuration data

8. **Which component in Kubernetes acts like a ground crew for containers, ensuring they are running as expected?**
   - A. API Server
   - B. Scheduler
   - C. Kubelet
   - D. Etcd

9. **What is a Kubernetes Service used for?**
   - A. Storing cluster state and configuration
   - B. Exposing a set of pods to the outside world or other services
   - C. Deciding which nodes should run new pods
   - D. Monitoring the health of nodes and pods

10. **What is the purpose of a Namespace in Kubernetes?**
    - A. To provide stable network endpoints for services
    - B. To divide cluster resources between multiple users or teams
    - C. To manage the communication between pods
    - D. To schedule pods to nodes
